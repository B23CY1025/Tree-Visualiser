Tree Visualizer Project
A web-based interactive visualization tool for Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and AVL Trees. This project helps users understand tree structures and algorithms through dynamic animations and visual feedback.

-->Features<--
->Three Tree Types:

1) Binary Tree (Level-Order Insertion)

2) Binary Search Tree (BST)

3) AVL Tree (Self-Balancing BST)

->Interactive Operations:

1) Insert nodes with visual feedback

2) Delete nodes with animation

3) Search for nodes with path highlighting

4) Tree traversal animations (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order)

5) Reset tree functionality

-->Visual Elements:

1) Animated node highlighting during operations

2) Clear visualization of tree structure with connecting lines

3) Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

-->How to Use<--
Open index.html in a web browser

->Select the type of tree you want to visualize:

1) Binary Tree

2) Binary Search Tree (BST)

3) AVL Tree

Use the controls panel to:

-> Insert values (enter number and click Insert)

-> Delete values

-> Search for values

-> Perform tree traversals

-> Reset the tree

-->Technical Details<--
-> JavaScript/C++ implementation of tree algorithms

-> CSS animations for visual feedback

-> Responsive design using flexbox

-> Object-oriented approach with TreeNode and Tree classes

-> Visual representation using absolute positioning and SVG-like lines

-->Requirements<--
-> Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

-> No server required - works directly from file system
